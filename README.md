# autocontainer
Repo for my CI/CD Automation container. This container, contains all the tools I need, across all my CI/CD pipelines

### Update 
I changed this to be build by my Gitlab CI/CD and pushed to my Harbor Registry.
Mostly due to Docker rate limits. 

Fell free to pull it directly from there using : 

```
docker pull registry.cmplab.dk/cmplab/autocontainer:latest
```
